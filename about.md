title: About me
---

Hello, my name is Santiago Rodriguez, and I work as a software engineer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have a strong interest in developing scalable systems, adhering to good coding practices, ensuring information security, and finding solutions to complex problems. In order to continually improve my abilities, I make a point of regularly reading books, articles, and participating in open source projects. I am committed to being a lifelong learner and I am excited to learn from those around me.

Random facts: I like cycling, playing airsoft. I'm kind of an artist too, I used to play the trumpet and now I'm currently experiencing with theater classes. Last but not least, I prepare a very good napoletana pizza.
